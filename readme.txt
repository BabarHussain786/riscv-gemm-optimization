# 🚀 Matrix Multiplication Optimization on RISC-V Architecture

This repository contains optimized implementations of matrix multiplication algorithms targeting RISC-V platforms, including **Banana Pi** and **Spacemit X60**. The project demonstrates the impact of algorithmic and compiler-level optimizations on performance, including techniques like **loop interchange**, **recursive divide-and-conquer**, **tiling**, **OpenMP parallelization**, and **auto-vectorization** using **RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Matrix multiplication is a core operation in numerous fields, from scientific computing to machine learning. Optimizing this computation on emerging open architectures like RISC-V is critical for building scalable and energy-efficient systems.

This project investigates and benchmarks various optimization techniques and evaluates their performance on real RISC-V hardware.

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

### 1. 🧑‍💻 Install RISC-V Toolchain

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu
```

### 2. 📝 Compile Matrix Multiplication Code

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O3 -march=rv64imac -mabi=lp64 -o matmul_rv src/matmul_recursive.c
```

> Replace `matmul_recursive.c` with your chosen implementation.

### 3. 🏃 Run the Executable on RISC-V

Run on actual hardware (e.g., Banana Pi) or via a RISC-V simulator:

```bash
./matmul_rv
```

### 4. 📈 Benchmark with `perf`

```bash
perf stat -e L1-dcache-loads,L1-dcache-load-misses ./matmul_rv
```

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- **Compiler optimization flags matter**: `-O3` significantly boosts performance.
- **Algorithm-architecture synergy**: Recursive and tiling methods effectively utilize RISC-V memory hierarchies.
- **Parallelism is powerful**: OpenMP and RVV extensions scale well on multi-core RISC-V chips.
